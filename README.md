# KION RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS DATASET

We added interactions in every zip folder and we did original dataset and translated dataset.

It is the dataset for an online competition, which we conducted in November 2021 - December 2022. We hosted the competition hosted on the Open Data Science platform 3. The main goal of the competition was to predict movies that the users watched within one week following the period covered by the dataset. We keep these interactions in the private part of the dataset, which was not available to the participants.
